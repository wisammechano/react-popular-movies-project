Our popular movies app will list the recent popular movies from the TMDB database. The app
will fetch the movies list in its home page. When a movie is clicked, we go to the movie details
page where extra details will be fetched.

The homepage will alos have a search bar with popup suggestions

The movie page will state the name, the review, the cast and any trailers available. The trailers
can have their own mediaplayer.
